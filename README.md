# Description
Fine-tuning Mistral-7B with QLORA and PEFT is an advanced natural language processing project that leverages state-of-the-art techniques to fine-tune the Mistral-7B language model for specific tasks. The project combines the power of Mistral-7B, a large-scale pretrained model, with Quantization-Aware Learning of Randomized Arithmetic (QLORA) and Progressive Early Filtered Training (PEFT) techniques to achieve enhanced model efficiency and performance.

# Key Features:
  Mistral-7B Pretrained Model: We start with the Mistral-7B pretrained model, which provides a strong foundation for various natural language processing tasks.  
  QLORA for Quantization: QLORA is employed to quantize the model's weights and activations, reducing the model's memory footprint and improving inference speed.  
  PEFT for Training: Progressive Early Filtered Training (PEFT) is used to train the model progressively, allowing for faster convergence and efficient utilization of resources.  
  Custom Data Preprocessing: The project includes custom data preprocessing pipelines to prepare the dataset for fine-tuning, ensuring that the model is trained on relevant input data.  
  Training and Inference: The project provides detailed instructions for training the fine-tuned model and using it for inference, making it accessible and practical for various natural language 
    processing tasks.

# How it Works:
  Data Preprocessing: The project starts with custom data preprocessing to format the input data in a way that is suitable for fine-tuning.
  Model Fine-tuning: The Mistral-7B model is fine-tuned using QLORA and PEFT techniques. This process optimizes the model's efficiency while preserving its performance.
  Training and Inference: Detailed instructions are provided for training the model and using it for inference. Users can adapt the fine-tuned model for their specific NLP tasks.
